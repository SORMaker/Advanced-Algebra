# Isomorphism

## Def.8

Euclidean spaces $V$ and $V^\prime$ over the real number field $\R$ are called isomorphic if there exists a bijection $\sigma$ from $V$ to $V^{\prime}$ satisfying:

1. $\sigma(\alpha + \beta) = \sigma(\alpha) + \sigma(\beta)$.
2. $\sigma(k\alpha) = k\sigma(\alpha)$.
3. $(\sigma(\alpha), \sigma(\beta) ) = (\alpha, \beta)$.

where $\alpha, \beta \in V$ and $k \in \R$.

Such a mapping $\sigma$ is called an isomorphism from $V$ to $V^{\prime}$.

 Some conclusions:

- Isomorphic Euclidean spaces must have the same dimension.
- Every n-dimensional Euclidean space is isomorphic to $\R^n$.
- Isomorphic is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

## Th.3

Two finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.
