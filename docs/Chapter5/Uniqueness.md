# Uniqueness

If A is congruent to B, then they have the same rank.

A matrix in standard form is a diagonal matrix, and the rank of a diagonal matrix is equal to the number of its non-zero elements on the main diagonal.

Therefore, in the standard form of a quadratic form, the number of square terms with non-zero coefficients is uniquely determined and is independent of the non-degenerate linear substitution used. 

This uniquely determined number is defined as the rank of the quadratic form, which is equal to the rank of its associated matrix.

Over a general field, the standard form of a quadratic form is not unique; it depends on the specific non-degenerate linear substitution that is made.
