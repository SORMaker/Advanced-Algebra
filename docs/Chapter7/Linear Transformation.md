# Linear Transformation

## Def.1

Let $V$ and $V'$ be two linear spaces over the field $P$. A mapping $\mathscr{A}$ from $V$ to $V'$ is called a linear transformation if $\mathscr{A}$ preserves addition and scalar multiplication.
$$
\mathscr{A}(\alpha + \beta) = \mathscr{A}(\alpha) + \mathscr{A}(\beta), \quad \mathscr{A}(k\alpha) = k\mathscr{A}(\alpha)
$$

> It's not difficult to deduce from the definition the following simple properties of a linear transformation.

## Pt.

First, Let $\mathscr{A}$ is a linear transformation of $V$, then
$$
\mathscr{A}(0) = 0, \quad \mathscr{A}(-\alpha) = -\mathscr{A}(\alpha).
$$
Second, a linear transformation preserves linear combinations.
$$
\mathscr{A}(k_1\alpha_1 + \cdots + k_r\alpha_r) = k_1\mathscr{A}(\alpha_1) + \cdots + k_r\mathscr{A}(\alpha_r).
$$
Third, a linear transformation maps a linearly dependent set of vectors to a linearly dependent set of vectors. 

However, it doesn't work the other way around.
